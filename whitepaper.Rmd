## What is Open Science? 

Open Science is the practice of striving for to make the process and
products of research transparent and reproducible, including open data,
open source software and code, open access publications, pre-prints,
and open lab notebooks. I use the term "open" to mean something that
is roughly consistent with the Budapest definition of "open" access,
permitting readers to reuse and remix content, but will avoid any strict
definition of what it means to be open, which is not only something of a
continuum but also a multi-dimensional concept.  This is most familiar and
precise in the context of copyright licensing, e.g. CC-BY is consistent
with this definition, though more restrictive CC licenses often used
by other publishers falls short of it (e.g. by restricting reuse or
remixing/re-purposing that is an important element of how science builds
upon existing work).  Software licensing uses a different vocabulary in
regard to openness. Permissive licenses such as MIT and BSD are closest
to the Budapest definition of Open Access, and are widley recommended by
Open Science advocates [see @Stodden2012]. For most purposes, the more
general classification of any "Open Source" license, e.g., as defined by
the Open Source Initiative <https://opensource.org>, widely recognized
as the authoritative definition,  also recognizes so-called viral or
copyleft licenses such as the GPL which include a clause similar to
the share-alike provision of Creative Commons. Openness in software
raises issues that go beyond the domain of Copyright law, in particular,
regarding the issue of patents. While the issue of viral/share-alike
clauses is likely the most discussed divide among open source licenses,
differences with respect to patent implications are at least as relevant:
for instance, many universities, including the University of California
system [@] permit the use of both certain permissive and copy-left open
source licenses (e.g. BSD-2, GPL-2) but forbid researchers to use others
(e.g. the permissive Apache license or the copyleft GPL-3) ostensibly
due to the potential patent rights that may be forfeited by the latter.
Similarly, the lawyers and scholars of the Open Source Initiative declined
approval of the Creative Commons Zero Public Domain Declaration, though
it is recognized as a Free, GPL-compatible license by the Free Software
Foundation, which oversees the GPL license [@]) over concerns about a
clause which states it has no patent implications [@]. Elsewhere, journals
[e.g. @PLOS_CompBio] and funders [e.g. @NSF] recognize only licenses already
recognized by OSI.  These examples illustrate that overly permissive
terms may be just as much a barrier to reuse as overly restrictive
licenses, and more generally, that precise and practical definitions
of "open" are difficult. In light of this, my definition of "Open" and
"Open Science" should be seen as aspirational rather than prescriptive;
a shared intent rather than shared practice.  Here I share my vision of
this shared intent, how it manifests in my research, and what are some
of the major challenges and opportunities for open science that lie ahead.

The importance of at least two of these pillars of open science: open
access and  open data -- have been so well established as to be now
be mandated in some form by most major journals and funders, and yet
remain very limited in their application due to economic, technological,
social and cultural constraints.  For instance, Open Access publishing
is mandated by NIH, Buroughs Welcomme Fund, and many other institutions,
but economic (interests of established publishers) and socio-cultural
constraints (historical reputation of journal selectivity and it's role on
academic success) have left us with a fractured system in with embargoes
that delay this access when it could be most relevant, splintering into
'publisher' and 'open' versions of content (e.g. pubmed, preprint or
institutional archives), among other issues.  While most journals have
long required any supporting data to be 'available on request', many
are becoming sensible to the well-documented [@] practical limitations
of this model and now require data archiving in public repositories.
In some ways the situation here is better than that of journal articles:
these data may be accessed without a paywall common to journal articles,
and the cost to authors depositing data zero or at very least much
less than typically found in article processing charges (APCs) of
open access journals [@Dryad].  However, technical and socio-cultural
expectations have made compliance with these journal policies difficult
and unpopular to enforce (or even measure), and have further limited
the usefulness of the data even when it is deposited owing to lack of
necessary metadata, context, and appropriate formats for facilitating
data preservation and reuse. Once again, academic incentives for success
(almost exclusively measured in the number of high impact publications)
are aligned against these practices, which take time away from other
pursuits, may facilitate research competitors, and which bring little
reward by themselves.  Further, a lack of user-appropriate technology
makes adopting best practices for data sharing extremely difficult.
Likewise, a lack of technological tools that can make effective use
of this highly heterogeneous data dramatically limits the scientific
insights that could otherwise be gleaned from it. Despite a general consensus
on when and how such published data should be cited, lack of training,
precedent, and limits on bibliographies impede this practice. 

The remaining pillars of open science: (3) open software and (4) open
lab notebooks and similar elements of the progress rather than products
of science (reagents, protocols, and so forth) are significantly less
discussed and developed into practices and policies of researchers,
journals, funders and other institutions. Advances in technology and the
rapid increase in scale of data available to many scientific disciplines
has made *using* software an increasingly essential element of almost
any scientific research, while also stimulating growing demand for
*developing* software to address specific data and research questions.
Open Software is starting to receive the attention that Open Data
has benefited from in the previous decade, with a handful of journals
developing tentative policies regarding the availability and sharing of
code (e.g. @Science2011 in 2011, the rise of so-called 'software journals'
such as PLOS Comp Bio, JOSS, JORS, and others). Nevertheless, the community

## Why is open science important for transforming research and learning?

Open science advances and accelerates research and training by making it easier to verify, correct, and extend existing research and training efforts. 



## How can open science increase the societal impact of university research?

Open science increases the societal impact of research and training
both directly and indirectly. Directly, Open science practices remove
barriers of access to scientific results by such methods as removing
paywalls through pre-prints and open access publication, contributing
structured, curated and robustly archived data to the global commons.
Public access to the products of publicly funded research is not only
ethical but also increases trust and participation in the process of 
scientific analysis and discovery.  Restricting access through paywalls,
license agreements that prohibit text mining, or 

While these arguments have been well established in the context of
academic literature [e.g. @PLOS_OA], the societal impact of open
science is even stronger in regard to access to data.  Much of the 
data behind scientific findings is not even available behind a paywall

## How is open science part of, and important for your own research, teaching, and service agendas? 

My research, teaching and service emphasize open science practices. All publications from my group are deposited in preprint servers and publisher's copies made available open access through the [University of California Open Access Policy](http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/).  Any original or processed data used in these publications is archived in an appropriate data archive, under a Public Domain declaration (CC0) with appropriate metadata and assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).  Code to reproduce the results of the analyses are made available through a public code repository under a permissive open source license (BSD-2) and a snapshot is archived in an appropriate academic repository with a DOI. Software developed in the course of an analysis is likewise archived and also actively supported & maintained (or deprecated when appropriate) through the appropriate software distribution archive (e.g. Central R Archive Network, CRAN, for R packages, or Docker Hub, for Docker images).  

## What are the major technical, organizational, social, or cultural challenges you face, particularly as related to openness and sharing within your university and academia?

## If you had a senior leadership role in a university, what would you do to promote change and improve your university?

## What risky and potentially transformative, big idea research proposal would you be writing if you had the right open science resources, and institutional support?   

I firmly believe the most transformative big research idea would be the creation of the right open science resources, including institutional support, in the first place, which would transform

Open Science faces substantial technical, organizational, social and cultural challenges; though socio-cultural issues are frequently less tractable.  In many instances, technical and social challenges are also intertwined.
