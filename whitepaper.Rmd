## What is Open Science? 

Open Science is the practice of striving for to make the process and products of research transparent and reproducible, including open data, open source software and code, open access publications, pre-prints, and open lab notebooks. I use the term "open" to mean something that is roughly consistent with the Budapest definition of "open" access, permitting readers to reuse and remix content, but will avoid any strict definition of what it means to be open, which is not only something of a continuum but also a multi-dimensional concept.  This is most familiar and precise in the context of copyright licensing, e.g. CC-BY is consistent with this definition, though more restrictive CC licenses often used by other publishers falls short of it (e.g. by restricting reuse or remixing/re-purposing that is an important element of how science builds upon existing work).  Software licensing uses a different vocabulary in regard to openness. Permissive licenses such as MIT and BSD are closest to the Budapest definition of Open Access, and are widley recommended by Open Science advocates [see @Stodden2012]. For most purposes, the more general classification of any "Open Source" license, e.g., as defined by the Open Source Initiative <https://opensource.org>, widely recognized as the authoritative definition,  also recognizes so-called viral or copyleft licenses such as the GPL which include a clause similar to the share-alike provision of Creative Commons. Openness in software raises issues that go beyond the domain of Copyright law, in particular, regarding the issue of patents. While the issue of viral/share-alike clauses is likely the most discussed divide among open source licenses, differences with respect to patent implications are at least as relevant: for instance, many universities, including the University of California system [@] permit the use of both certain permissive and copy-left open source licenses (e.g. BSD-2, GPL-2) but forbid researchers to use others (e.g. the permissive Apache license or the copyleft GPL-3) ostensibly due to the potential patent rights that may be forfeited by the latter.  Similarly, the lawyers and scholars of the Open Source Initiative declined approval of the Creative Commons Zero Public Domain Declaration, though it is recognized as a Free, GPL-compatible license by the Free Software Foundation, which oversees the GPL license [@]) over concerns about a clause which states it has no patent implications [@]. Elsewhere, journals [e.g. @PLOS] and funders [e.g. @NSF] recognize only licenses already recognized by OSI.  These examples illustrate that overly permissive terms may be just as much a barrier to reuse as overly restrictive licenses, and more generally, that precise and practical definitions of "open" are difficult. In light of this, my definition of "Open" and "Open Science" should be seen as aspirational rather than prescriptive; a shared intent rather than shared practice.  Here I share my vision of this shared intent, how it manifests in my research, and what are some of the major challenges and opportunities for open science that lie ahead.

## Why is open science important for transforming research and learning?

Open science advances research and training by making it easier to verify, correct, and extend existing research and training efforts.

Open science increases the societal impact of research and training both directly and indirectly. Open science practices remove barriers of access to scientific results by such methods as removing paywalls through pre-prints and open access publication, contributing structured, curated and robustly archived data to the global commons, and increasing trust and participation in the process of scientific analysis and discovery.

## How is open science part of, and important for your own research, teaching, and service agendas? 

My research, teaching and service emphasize open science practices. All publications from my group are deposited in preprint servers and publisher's copies made available open access through the [University of California Open Access Policy](http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/).  Any original or processed data used in these publications is archived in an appropriate data archive, under a Public Domain declaration (CC0) with appropriate metadata and assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).  Code to reproduce the results of the analyses are made available through a public code repository under a permissive open source license (BSD-2) and a snapshot is archived in an appropriate academic repository with a DOI. Software developed in the course of an analysis is likewise archived and also actively supported & maintained (or deprecated when appropriate) through the appropriate software distribution archive (e.g. Central R Archive Network, CRAN, for R packages, or Docker Hub, for Docker images).  

## What are the major technical, organizational, social, or cultural challenges you face, particularly as related to openness and sharing within your university and academia?

## If you had a senior leadership role in a university, what would you do to promote change and improve your university?

## What risky and potentially transformative, big idea research proposal would you be writing if you had the right open science resources, and institutional support?   

I firmly believe the most transformative big research idea would be the creation of the right open science resources, including institutional support, in the first place, which would transform 
If I had all the necessary technical and social open science infrastructure already in place, 

Teaching materials are made publicly available under permissive licensing.

Open Science faces substantial technical, organizational, social and cultural challenges; though socio-cultural issues are frequently less tractable.  In many instances, technical and social challenges are also intertwined. 

Technical challenges: 

- Concerns about misuse of open material
