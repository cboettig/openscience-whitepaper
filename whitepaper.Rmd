          This whitepaper was written in response to seven questions on open science
          issued by invitation to the NSF/NIH ImagineU Conference 
          (<http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/Conferences/ImagineU/>) to be held on March 8-9, 2017.
          These answers reflect my own experiences and opinions at the time of writing, and
          focus primarly though not exclusively on examples from my own field of ecology and
          evolutionary biology, though I believe the trends and possibilities highlighted here
          are shared to great extent by other fields.  This is a working paper whose primary
          goal is to spark discussion, not provide a comprehensive or authoritative viewpoint
          of the practice and potential of open science.

## What is Open Science? 

Open Science is the practice of striving for to make the process and
products of research transparent and reproducible, including open data,
open source software and code, open access publications, pre-prints,
and open lab notebooks. 

### So what exactly does "open" mean?

I use the term "open" to mean something that
is roughly consistent with the Budapest definition of "open" access,
permitting readers to reuse and remix content, but will avoid any strict
definition of what it means to be open, which is not only something of a
continuum but also a multi-dimensional concept.  This is most familiar and
precise in the context of copyright licensing, e.g. CC-BY is consistent
with this definition, though more restrictive CC licenses often used
by other publishers falls short of it (e.g. by restricting reuse or
remixing/re-purposing that is an important element of how science builds
upon existing work).  Software licensing uses a different vocabulary in
regard to openness. Permissive licenses such as MIT and BSD are closest
to the Budapest definition of Open Access, and are widley recommended by
Open Science advocates [see @Stodden2012]. For most purposes, the more
general classification of any "Open Source" license, e.g., as defined by
the Open Source Initiative <https://opensource.org>, widely recognized
as the authoritative definition,  also recognizes so-called viral or
copyleft licenses such as the GPL which include a clause similar to
the share-alike provision of Creative Commons. Openness in software
raises issues that go beyond the domain of Copyright law, in particular,
regarding the issue of patents. While the issue of viral/share-alike
clauses is likely the most discussed divide among open source licenses,
differences with respect to patent implications are at least as relevant:
for instance, many universities, including the University of California
system^[1] permit the use of both certain permissive and copy-left open
source licenses (e.g. BSD-2, GPL-2) but forbid researchers to use others
(e.g. the permissive Apache license or the copyleft GPL-3) ostensibly
due to the potential patent rights that may be forfeited by the latter.
Similarly, the lawyers and scholars of the Open Source Initiative declined
approval of the Creative Commons Zero Public Domain Declaration, though
it is recognized as a Free, GPL-compatible license by the Free Software
Foundation, which oversees the GPL license over concerns about a
clause which states it has no patent implications (see <https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review/2012-February/thread.html>). Elsewhere, journals
[e.g. @PLOS_CompBio] and funders [e.g. @NSF] recognize only licenses already
recognized by OSI.  **These examples illustrate that overly permissive
terms may be just as much a barrier to reuse as overly restrictive
licenses, and more generally, that precise and practical definitions
of "open" are difficult**. In light of this, my definition of "Open" and
"Open Science" should be seen as aspirational rather than prescriptive;
a shared intent rather than shared practice.  Here I share my vision of
this shared intent, how it manifests in my research, and what are some
of the major challenges and opportunities for open science that lie ahead.

### The Current state of open science


The Whitehouse memo "Open by Default" 

## Why is open science important for transforming research and learning?

Open science advances and accelerates research and training by making it easier to verify, correct, and extend existing research and training efforts. 



## How can open science increase the societal impact of university research?

Open science increases the societal impact of research and training
both directly and indirectly. Directly, Open science practices remove
barriers of access to scientific results by such methods as removing
paywalls through pre-prints and open access publication, contributing
structured, curated and robustly archived data to the global commons.
Public access to the products of publicly funded research is not only
ethical but also increases trust and participation in the process of 
scientific analysis and discovery.  Restricting access through paywalls,
license agreements that prohibit text mining, or 

While these arguments have been well established in the context of
academic literature [e.g. @PLOS_OA], the societal impact of open
science is even stronger in regard to access to data.  Much of the 
data behind scientific findings is not even available behind a paywall

## How is open science part of, and important for your own research, teaching, and service agendas? 

My research, teaching and service emphasize open science practices. All publications from my group are deposited in preprint servers and publisher's copies made available open access through the [University of California Open Access Policy](http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/).  Any original or processed data used in these publications is archived in an appropriate data archive, under a Public Domain declaration (CC0) with appropriate metadata and assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).  Code to reproduce the results of the analyses are made available through a public code repository under a permissive open source license (BSD-2) and a snapshot is archived in an appropriate academic repository with a DOI. Software developed in the course of an analysis is likewise archived and also actively supported & maintained (or deprecated when appropriate) through the appropriate software distribution archive (e.g. Central R Archive Network, CRAN, for R packages, or Docker Hub, for Docker images).  

## What are the major technical, organizational, social, or cultural challenges you face, particularly as related to openness and sharing within your university and academia?

The

Before addressing the questions posed by this white paper, I think it is
useful to establish some broad context as to the present state of open 
science practices.  While there is great heterogeneity in the manner and 
degree of open science practiced in different fields, countries, journals,
and institutions, I believe that several broad generalizations are possible.
Recognizing these generalizations first will permit me to focus my replies
to these queries on those areas where the benefits have been least-well
enunciated, accepted, or put into practice by our scientific communities. 

The importance of at least two of these pillars of open science: open
access and  open data -- have been so well established as to be now
be mandated in some form by most major journals and funders [e.g @Gewin2016; @Roche2015]. 

### Open Access

The terms of debate on open access and data archiving have been clearly articulated
for some time throughout the scientific literature (in contrast to the other
pillars of software and notebooks).  However, more widespread practice of data sharing,
and to a lesser extent of open access, remains more 
limited in their application due to economic, technological,
social and cultural constraints.  For instance, while Open Access publishing
is mandated by NIH, Buroughs Welcomme Fund, and many other institutions,
economic (interests of established publishers) and socio-cultural
constraints (historical reputation of journal selectivity and it's role on
academic success) have left us with a fractured system in which embargoes
delay access and splinter content into
'publisher' and 'open' versions of content (e.g. pubmed, preprint or
institutional archives).  


### Open Data

While most journals have
long required any supporting data to be 'available on request', many
are becoming sensible to the well-documented [e.g. @Roche2015 and references therein] practical limitations
of this model and now require data archiving in public repositories.
In some ways the situation here is better than that of journal articles:
these data may be accessed without a paywall common to journal articles,
and the cost to authors depositing data zero or at very least much
less than typically found in article processing charges (APCs) of
open access journals [@Dryad].  However, technical and socio-cultural
expectations have made compliance with these journal policies difficult
and unpopular to enforce (or even measure), and have further limited
the usefulness of the data even when it is deposited owing to lack of
necessary metadata, context, and appropriate formats for facilitating
data preservation and reuse. Once again, academic incentives for success
(almost exclusively measured in the number of high impact publications)
are aligned against these practices, which take time away from other
pursuits, may facilitate research competitors, and which bring little
reward by themselves.  Further, a lack of user-appropriate technology
makes adopting best practices for data sharing extremely difficult.
Likewise, a lack of technological tools that can make effective use
of this highly heterogeneous data dramatically limits the scientific
insights that could otherwise be gleaned from it. Despite a general consensus
on when and how such published data should be cited, lack of training,
precedent, and limits on bibliographies impede this practice. 

### Open Software

The remaining pillars of open science: (3) open software and (4) open
lab notebooks and similar elements of the progress rather than products
of science (reagents, protocols, and so forth) are significantly less
discussed and developed into practices and policies of researchers,
journals, funders and other institutions. Advances in technology and the
rapid increase in scale of data available to many scientific disciplines
has made *using* software an increasingly essential element of almost
any scientific research, while also stimulating growing demand for
*developing* software to address specific data and research questions.
Open Software is starting to receive the attention that Open Data
has benefited from in the previous decade, with a handful of journals
developing tentative policies regarding the availability and sharing of
code (e.g. @Science2011 in 2011, the rise of so-called 'software journals'
such as PLOS Comp Bio, JOSS, JORS, and others). Nevertheless, the community


### Open context (notebooks, protocols, etc)


## If you had a senior leadership role in a university, what would you do to promote change and improve your university?

## What risky and potentially transformative, big idea research proposal would you be writing if you had the right open science resources, and institutional support?   

I firmly believe the most transformative big research idea would be the creation of the right open science resources, including institutional support, in the first place.  While I will always be excited and fascniated by research in my own field in theoretical ecology and conservation decision-making and argue as vigorously as the next scientist about the fundamental importance of understanding the natural ecosystems that support our food security, economic and cultural stability, research which transforms how much larger parts of our scientific community generates knowledge and sees that knowledge translated into invention, policy, and application will by its very definition have greater and broader impact. Many of the most transformative changes to happen both in science and beyond in the past several decades have been the result not of demonstrating that something was possible for a small group of highly specialized individuals, but in demonstrating that it was practical at scales which made the previously inconcievable routine: high throughput sequencing, Moore's law, big data and machine learning. That the most transformative work increases the productivity of the greatest number of researchers (both in academia and beyond) is nearly tautological. Status quo practices that stand in contrast to open science practices are some of the most obvious and artificial sources of inefficency in research productivity, since they only increase friction (or more precisely, prevent the decrease in friction due to technological advances) in access and exchange of scientific knowledge.  Few if any of these practices prevent exchange and thus provide some potentially valuable protection (e.g. in the manner of a patent), but instead add friction in the form of paywalls, data that can only be accessed on request and manually converted to a machine readable form, and so forth.  

To make this concrete,

Open Science faces substantial technical, organizational, social and cultural challenges; though socio-cultural issues are frequently less tractable.  In many instances, technical and social challenges are also intertwined.
