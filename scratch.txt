### So what exactly does "open" mean?

I use the term "open" to mean something that
is roughly consistent with the Budapest definition of "open" access,
permitting readers to reuse and remix content, but will avoid any strict
definition of what it means to be open, which is not only something of a
continuum but also a multi-dimensional concept.  This is most familiar and
precise in the context of copyright licensing, e.g. CC-BY is consistent
with this definition, though more restrictive CC licenses often used
by other publishers falls short of it (e.g. by restricting reuse or
remixing/re-purposing that is an important element of how science builds
upon existing work).  Software licensing uses a different vocabulary in
regard to openness. Permissive licenses such as MIT and BSD are closest
to the Budapest definition of Open Access, and are widely recommended by
Open Science advocates [see @Stodden2009]. For most purposes, the more
general classification of any "Open Source" license, e.g., as defined by
the Open Source Initiative <https://opensource.org>, widely recognized
as the authoritative definition,  also recognizes so-called viral or
copyleft licenses such as the GPL which include a clause similar to
the share-alike provision of Creative Commons. Openness in software
raises issues that go beyond the domain of Copyright law, in particular,
regarding the issue of patents. While the issue of viral/share-alike
clauses is likely the most discussed divide among open source licenses,
differences with respect to patent implications are at least as relevant:
for instance, many universities, including the University of California
system permit the use of both certain permissive and copy-left open
source licenses (e.g. BSD-2, GPL-2) but forbid researchers to use others
(e.g. the permissive Apache license or the copyleft GPL-3) ostensibly
due to the potential patent rights that may be forfeited by the latter.
Similarly, the lawyers and scholars of the Open Source Initiative declined
approval of the Creative Commons Zero Public Domain Declaration, though
it is recognized as a Free, GPL-compatible license by the Free Software
Foundation, which oversees the GPL license over concerns about a
clause which states it has no patent implications (see <https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review/2012-February/thread.html>). Elsewhere, journals
(e.g. PLOS CompBio) and funders (e.g. National Science Foundation) recognize only licenses already
recognized by OSI.  **These examples illustrate that overly permissive
terms may be just as much a barrier to reuse as overly restrictive
licenses, and more generally, that precise and practical definitions
of "open" are difficult**. In light of this, my definition of "Open" and
"Open Science" should be seen as aspirational rather than prescriptive;
a shared intent rather than shared practice.  Here I share my vision of
this shared intent, how it manifests in my research, and what are some
of the major challenges and opportunities for open science that lie ahead.


## Challenges and Opportunities


Open science advances and accelerates research and training by making it easier to verify, correct, and extend existing research and training efforts. Barriers to access any component of scientific research: conclusions, methods, data, software tools, etc, inherently slow the progress of science.  

<!--
Open science increases the societal impact of research and training
both directly and indirectly. Directly, Open science practices remove
barriers of access to scientific results by such methods as removing
paywalls through pre-prints and open access publication, contributing
structured, curated and robustly archived data to the global commons.
Public access to the products of publicly funded research is not only
ethical but also increases trust and participation in the process of 
scientific analysis and discovery.  Restricting access through paywalls,
license agreements, inconsistent and proprietarty formats not only slow the normal
research process, but also make it impossible to perform 
transformative work of synthesizing, evaluating and extending research at scale.
-->

The best way to understand the importance of Open Science is to understand how these barriers currently impact research.
This will help establish some broad context as to the present state of open 
science practices.  While there is great heterogeneity in the manner and 
degree of open science practiced in different fields, countries, journals,
and institutions, I believe that several broad generalizations are possible.
Recognizing these generalizations first will permit me to focus my replies
to these queries on those areas where the benefits have been least-well
enunciated, accepted, or put into practice by our scientific communities. 

I attempt to address these related questions on the *importance* and the *challenges* together:

1. Why is open science important for transforming research and learning? 
2. What are the major technical, organizational, social, or cultural challenges you face, particularly as related to openness and sharing within your university and academia?
3. How can open science increase the societal impact of university research?

Despite the obvious synergies between the different elements of open science in scientific research as a process, I think it is essential to take the different components: open access, open data, open code, and open context, separately in order to understand the current challenges and opportunities each entails.
The different components of open science are primarily important to somewhat different audiences, and have achieved different degrees of recognition. I address the challenges and opportunities of each pillar in turn here, deferring to other literature where the case or at least the terms of debate have already been clearly established in the community. The importance of at least two of these pillars of open science: open
access and  open data -- have been so well established as to be now
be mandated in some form by most major journals and funders [e.g @Gewin2016; @Roche2015]. 
The other two remain much more of the frontier.

### Open Access

The terms of debate on open access and data archiving have been clearly articulated
for some time throughout the scientific literature: after all, the importance of that literature
as representing the progress and deliverables of science has never been in doubt.
The primary barrier to open access today is the historical prestige of leading
subscription-based journals, which researchers are reluctant to abandon and publishers
reluctant to tamper with.  Though new journals at all levels tend towards an open
access model, the tight coupling of credit and prestige with established journals
makes a rapid transition towards open access unlikely.  Meanwhile, mandates by
funders such as NIH, Burroughs Welcomme Fund, as well as institutional requirements
such as the University of California Open Access Policy have instead largely promoted
a model which splinters content into 'publisher' and 'open' versions through the use
of preprint or institutional archives.  Because institutions responsible for the
lion's share of research dollars usually have subscription access to the most
relevant journals, those with the most influence have the least incentive to change
this system.  Fortunately, some of the more transformative potential of open 
science lies in other venues that face barriers not quite so entrenched.

### Open Data

While most journals have long required any supporting data to be 'available on request', many
are becoming sensible to the well-documented [e.g. @Roche2015 and references therein] practical limitations
of this model and now require data archiving in public repositories.
In some ways the situation here is better than that of journal articles:
these data may be accessed without a paywall common to journal articles,
and the cost to authors depositing data zero or at very least much
less than typically found in article processing charges (APCs) of
open access journals (e.g. <http://dataDryad.org>).  No doubt this reflects the relative absence of
already-entrenched interests in academic publishing.  Access to large pools
of *scientific data* free of paywalls and copyright could be far more transformative
than open access to scientific papers alone, as in the age of data science
the processing of such data can *scale* through automation and algorithm in 
a way that its qualitative textual descriptions in papers never will.  [e.g. see @Reichman2011].
Further, scientific data 
accessible free from paywalls and copyright 
should be far easier to recombine in novel ways to pursue
questions relevant to both academic and industry research. 

However, technical and socio-cultural
expectations have made compliance with these journal policies difficult
and unpopular to enforce (or even measure), and have further limited
the usefulness of the data even when it is deposited.  Standards for organizing,
annotating, and distributing scientific data are often immature or ignored
by researchers never trained in the curation of  necessary metadata, context, 
and formats that facilitating data preservation and reuse. Once again, academic incentives for success
(almost exclusively measured in the number of high impact publications)
are aligned against these practices, since they can take time away from other
pursuits, may facilitate research competitors, and which bring little
reward by themselves.  Further, a lack of user-appropriate technology
makes adopting best practices for data sharing extremely difficult.
Likewise, a lack of technological tools that can make effective use
of this highly heterogeneous data dramatically limits the scientific
insights that could otherwise be gleaned from it. Despite a general consensus
on when and how such published data should be cited, lack of training,
precedent, and limits on bibliographies impede this practice. 

As a result of these forces, we currently enjoy rapidly growing
data archives but have been able to realize little of the transformative
potential that truly open data can enable.  In time, ever growing-archives,
new learning and inference methods and the existence of some well-annotated
data sets may overcome the lack of standards and metadata, but real progress
will require greater recognition of data as a product of scientific research
in order to promote higher standards of its preparation and curation.

### Open Code

The remaining pillars of open science: (3) open code and (4) open
lab notebooks and similar elements of the progress rather than products
of science (reagents, protocols, and so forth) are significantly less
discussed and developed into practices and policies of researchers,
journals, funders and other institutions. Advances in technology and the
rapid increase in scale of data available to many scientific disciplines
has made *using* software an increasingly essential element of almost
any scientific research, while also stimulating growing demand for
*developing* software to address specific data and research questions.
Open code is starting to receive the attention that Open Data
has benefited from in the previous decade, with a handful of journals discussing or
developing tentative policies regarding the availability and sharing of
code (e.g. new policy at _Science_ [@Hanson2011], the rise of so-called 'software journals'
such as PLOS Comp Bio, JOSS, JORS, and others).  

Open code may be subdivided into "software," which I will use to refer
to any code written with the intent that other researchers may use it
as a tool to perform other research, vs "code" which researchers write 
in pursuit of their own research.  This will always be more of a continuum
than a binary division -- in practice "code" that follows certain best-practices
(functionalized, appropriate abstractions) can be very useful for further 
research, while some software development teams may have few real users.  
(This division between intent is also present in data archiving, between
large team efforts such as genome sequencing or NEON that seek to generate
well-curated data for others, vs the long-tail of data being generated en 
route to an individual researcher's own objectives).  The challenges and opportunities
are somewhat different between these categories. With respect to open code,
the primary objective of open science movement has been to encourage researchers
to "publish your code, it is good enough" [@Barnes2010]. Access to such code is 
often essential to replicating and understanding results drawn from it.  In contrast, 
the emphasis on open software is that it has largely not been good enough -- more 
attention to best practices of software development and open source community-building
can improve the reliability, usability, provenance, integrity, and reproducibility
of the software over the long term (e.g. see papers from the WSSSPE workshops, http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/).


### Open context (open notebooks, open protocols, open reviews, etc)

These elements have received the least attention -- indeed it is not clear
that they should be should truly be lumped together. Yet each of these
components face a more fundamental division from those previously discussed
in that they shift the focus from something that can become recognized as a
*product* in it's own right to something that is part of the *process*. Ultimately
a shift from *product to process* captures the ideal of open science -- by 
it's nature scientific research is always a work in progress which builds on
previous products.  The ability to share process directly both improves our 
ability validate and uncover limitations of previous work as well as extend and
synthesize isolated results into general patterns.



## How is open science part of, and important for your own research, teaching, and service agendas? 

## If you had a senior leadership role in a university, what would you do to promote change and improve your university?

Open science practices often fall outside the standard academic scope of incentives and the currency of hiring and promoting.  It is possible and can be effective to align these objectives whenever possible: for instance, software papers can translate software development into a more traditional currency of publication and citation, and certain grant opportunities may look favorably on open science goals and practices, and a researcher recognized for these practices may enjoy less tangible benefits of recognition. Yet for the most part these efforts will be at odds with the expectation to publish regularly in prestigious venues which makes up the cornerstone of scientific reward.  The best thing senior university leadership can do to promote open science would be to protect and encourage these practices among junior faculty.  

## What risky and potentially transformative, big idea research proposal would you be writing if you had the right open science resources, and institutional support?   

I firmly believe the most transformative big research idea would be the creation of the right open science resources, including institutional support, in the first place.  While I will always be excited and fascinated by research in my own field in theoretical ecology and conservation decision-making and argue as vigorously as the next scientist about the fundamental importance of understanding the natural ecosystems that support our food security, economic and cultural stability, research which transforms how much larger parts of our scientific community generates knowledge and sees that knowledge translated into invention, policy, and application will by its very definition have greater and broader impact. Many of the most transformative changes to happen both in science and beyond in the past several decades have been the result not of demonstrating that something was possible for a small group of highly specialized individuals, but in demonstrating that it was practical at scales which made the previously inconceivable routine: high throughput sequencing, Moore's law, big data and machine learning. That the most transformative work increases the productivity of the greatest number of researchers (both in academia and beyond) is nearly tautological. Status quo practices that stand in contrast to open science practices are some of the most obvious and artificial sources of inefficiency in research productivity, since they only increase friction (or more precisely, prevent the decrease in friction due to technological advances) in access and exchange of scientific knowledge.  Few if any of these practices prevent exchange and thus provide some potentially valuable protection (e.g. in the manner of a patent), but instead add friction in the form of paywalls, data that can only be accessed on request and manually converted to a machine readable form.   Research data is most useful when it is preserved in open, machine-readable, well annotated formats.  Results are most useful when they can reach the largest audience, be more easily validated, reproduced and extended. Research software will make little impact if it is poorly maintained or cannot be extended to changing types and sizes of data or integrated with other methods. 

Only through education training of the next generation can we accomplish wide-reaching reform of such practices.  We need a generation of scientists who  both the knowledge and the desire to perform research in a manner that maximizes its potential impact. Basic training in broad-sense data science and reproducible research is fundamental for this transformation, both in academia and beyond.
